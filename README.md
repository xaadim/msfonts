# msfonts

This is a simples script that installs ms fonts in a linux box.

Tested only in archlinux.

To install it, run:

	curl -L https://github.com/caarlos0/msfonts/raw/master/install.sh | sudo sh

or with wget:

    wget -qO- https://github.com/caarlos0/msfonts/raw/master/install.sh | sudo sh


> Note: The script will automagically install git if you doesn't have it.
